# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Game.create(day: 4, night: 2, num_players: 4)
# Game.create(day: 1, night: 7, num_players: 7)
# Game.create(day: 7, night: 3, num_players: 5)
# Game.create(day: 8, night: 7, num_players: 2)

# User.create(name: "Zac", game_id: 1)
# User.create(name: "Dee", game_id: 1)
# User.create(name: "Zac@Zac", game_id: 1)
# User.create(name: "Avi", game_id: 1)


# User.create(name: "Dennis", game_id: 2)
# User.create(name: "Joseph", game_id: 2)
# User.create(name: "Zac@Zac", game_id: 2)
# User.create(name: "Avi", game_id: 2)
